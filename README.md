# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis



Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to learn about machiene learning, and utilize machiene learning to optimize the analysis of data. We are creating a machiene learning platform to help predict if funding will be successful or not. In Deliverable one we recieved the charity data, which would give us our raw data needed to form a model. Next we evaulated our indexes based of specific criteria that would help determine if the charity funding will be sucessful or not. In deliverable two after setting up the critieria we tested how accurate the module was to predicting how sucessful the prediction would be.

Results
Using 100 epochs we analyied the accuracy of the model. We found the module to be accurate 72 percent of the time. This means the regression model will predict the optimal charity to allocate the money to. This way the machiene will determine which charity, which is less prone to error. In deliverable 3 of this Module we had to opitimize the mode to achieve an accuracy greater than 75 percent. I was unable to get the module above 75 percent averaging around a high 74 percent, but I did make 3 attempts to try and optimize the module. Firstly the number of epochs was increased from 100 to 1000. Secondly, a third hidden layer was added with 5 units. Finally the amount of units increased in the layers from 10 to 50.

Summary
The overall results is the module was around 75 percent of the time accurate for funding allocation. This will prove useful for the funding company as they can make more accurate predictions with their money allocation. One different way this problem could be solved is using different metric for the machiene learning. This may prove to be more effective for the macheine learning.
