# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to learn about machiene learning, and utilize machiene learning to optimize the analysis of data. We are creating a machiene learning platform to help predict if funding will be successful or not. In Deliverable one we recieved the charity data, which would give us our raw data needed to form a model. Next we evaulated our indexes based of specific criteria that would help determine if the charity funding will be sucessful or not. In deliverable two after setting up the critieria we tested how accurate the module was to predicting how sucessful the prediction would be.

Results
Using 100 epochs we analyied the accuracy of the model. We found the module to be accurate 72 percent of the time meaning
